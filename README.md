# RiceRocks #
RiceRocks Python game outside CodeSculptor

## Project description ##
In May/June 2013 I completed the Coursera.org course "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python" (https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython, now a two-part course part of the "Fundamentals of Computing Specialization"). This course aims at learning the basics of building simple interactive applications using Python. I chose this course to learn the basics of Pyhton and to repeat programming fundamentals.

The course was divided into 8 mini-projects, working towards a working version of the game Rice Rocks (the course's version of Asteroids). Topics covered included OOP and event driven programming. Programming was done in a browser-based programming environment, CodeSkulptor.org, developed especially for this course. It provides a module called simplegui that takes care of the graphics, keyboard and mouse, so the students can focus on the actual game logic. I would like to refer to the course syllabus (see at the bottom of this file or http://www.codeskulptor.org/coursera/interactivepython.html) for details on topics covered. My original RiceRocks game can be found at http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user16_e6F8aer7ZhTPlYb_8.py (my name isn't on it, but I tell you, it's mine).

In this repo, I will create a version of the game that will run outside CodeSkulptor. The aim is to have some reference of my Python and programming skills. If you do not like this, don't tell me, or there will be some French taunting.

## "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python" course syllabus ##

This class consists of two parts that are five and four weeks long, respectively.  For most weeks, you will watch two sets of videos (part a and part b) and then complete one quiz for each set. The main task for each week is to complete a mini-project that is due along with the quizzes early Sunday morning.  You will then be asked to assess your peer's mini-projects on the following Sunday-Wednesday.
